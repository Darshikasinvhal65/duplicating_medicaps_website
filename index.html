                    <h2>WELCOME TO <br> <span>MEDI-CAPS UNIVERSITY</span></h2>
                    <p>Medi-Caps has been a brand name in the arena of technical 
                    education. Since its inception in July 2000, Medi-Caps has
                    consistently aimed at creating an ideal ambiance for budding
                    technocrats and managers; and helping them to grow like true
                    professionals. With its highly qualified faculty there seems
                    an optimal blend of academic brilliance and industry exposure,
                    supplemented by highly specialized visiting faculty and industry experts,
                    senior professionals from various segments of different industries and
                    business houses. It was time now to spread wings and move out for
                    more exposure and widening of the periphery.</p>
                    <p>Hence the foundation of Medi-Caps University has been laid down.
                    With a strong foundation of the Group since 15 years, Medi-Caps University
                    wishes to maintain the same objective of imparting quality education and
                    producing sound professionals for the benefit of the society at large.</p>
